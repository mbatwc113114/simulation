![Project Banner](https://via.placeholder.com/1000x300.png?text=Simulation+Project) <!-- Replace with an actual banner image if available -->

## 🚀 Overview

This repository contains a **simulation project** designed for [specific purpose, e.g., robotics, mechanical systems, AI, etc.]. The simulation is built using [mention technologies/frameworks, e.g., ROS 2, OpenCV, Gazebo, Python, etc.] and provides an interactive environment for testing and analysis.

## 📌 Features

- 🔹 [Feature 1: e.g., Real-time visualization]
- 🔹 [Feature 2: e.g., Multi-agent simulation]
- 🔹 [Feature 3: e.g., Customizable parameters]
- 🔹 [Feature 4: e.g., Integration with hardware]

## 🛠 Installation

### Prerequisites
